# Lab 2 -- quiz

For my lab 2 I made a quiz to see what Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavor you are. I went with the CSS focus for part 2 of the lab.

## What Worked Well
Swapping out the different texts and images to display based on the quiz answers worked pretty well; my first approach worked for the titles and descriptions (truly a rare occasion) but was unsuccessful for the images, but the second approach I tried for swapping out the images works well I think (although I had a type error I didn't know was there that I did have to get help to find). 

## What Didn't
I really struggled to get the various states working for my radio boxes (specifically the state where a radio box changes when clicked, and the state where all non-clicked radio boxes change differently when one is clicked). My code worked completely fine while I had the little boxes visible, but as soon as I hid the boxes (so that just my cover images were visible), my little "clicked" and "not clicked" states also went away. Because I was working on this on a day where I couldn't make it to office hours I ended up posting a question on stack overflow and got a very helpful response, which I then took to office hours later to get help understanding what the syntax was doing and fix it where needed for my specific situation. 

## Extra Credit

## Screenshots

I'm not sure how many screenshots to include so I've just put three to show some of the general styling (a hover state, a couple of clicked states) and how the results modal looks (it is at its biggest in the screenshot)
